Abstract: Abstract



**TODO**

* add the server inference results *howto*
* add python enviroments and docker instructions
* make the code device agnostic (replace paths and IP addresses with argparse)
* differentiate *persample metrics* and *global metrics*
* yaml for yolo detection only vs detection+classification
